# CafeExMachina
  This project was a school project, developed by me, Ben Harvey (1benharvey1213), Dalin Christianson (JobeFarkley), Jacob Graupman (JacobGraupmann), and Andrew Hersh (ahersh43) with their github accounts in parenthesis. The original repository for this project can be found at https://github.com/benharvey1213/cafe-ex-machina. CafeExMachina was a web application made using Angular to mock an online automatic cafe, where a user could view a cafe menu, order drinks and food, be given a receipt, and be show a mock "order status" page. This web app was made for our Advanced Software Development class for NDSU. My contribution involved the individual component for an individual food item when shown in a category list while in the menu, where a user could click a button to add the item to their order. I also made the majority of wireframe mock-ups for the design of the multiple pages. If you would like to download and view the project yourself, make sure to run npm install in the terminal.



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.7.
